== Conformance

[[conformance_profiles]]
=== Conformance Profiles

There are four Sparkplug target applications. A Sparkplug infrastructure typically consists of one
or more of the following application types

* Sparkplug Edge Node
* Sparkplug Host Application
* Sparkplug Compliant MQTT Server
* Sparkplug Aware MQTT Server

Each application type has specific conformance requirements that must be met. Typically a Sparkplug
application would only implement one of these profiles. For example an MQTT client wouldn't
typically be both an Edge Node and a Host Application.

[[conformance_sparkplug_edge_node]]
==== Sparkplug Edge Node

A Sparkplug Edge Node is typically an 'Edge Gateway'. It sends and receives data to an MQTT Server
using the spBv1.0/# namespace. Edge Nodes typically interact with physical devices to gather data
and also write to device outputs.

[[conformance_sparkplug_host_application]]
==== Sparkplug Host Application

A Sparkplug Host Application is typically at a 'central location' and primarily receives data from
multiple Sparkplug Edge Nodes. It also may send command messages to Sparkplug Edge Nodes to write to
outputs of Sparkplug Edge Nodes and/or Devices. Sparkplug Host Applications may also sends rebirth
requests to Edge Nodes when required.

Host Applications MUST publish 'STATE' messages that represent its Birth and Death Certificates.*#

[[conformance_mqtt_server]]
==== Sparkplug Compliant MQTT Server

Sparkplug infrastructures have a specific subset of requirements on MQTT Servers. Any fully MQTT
v3.1.1 or v5.0 MQTT Server will meet the requirements of Sparkplug infrastructures. However, not all
of the features of the MQTT Specification are required. The following are the required portions of
the MQTT Specification that a Sparkplug Compliant MQTT Server must meet.

* [tck-testable tck-id-conformance-mqtt-qos0]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-conformance-mqtt-qos0] A
Sparkplug conformant MQTT Server MUST support publish and subscribe on QoS 0*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-conformance-mqtt-qos1]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-conformance-mqtt-qos1] A
Sparkplug conformant MQTT Server MUST support publish and subscribe on QoS 1*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-conformance-mqtt-will-messages]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-conformance-mqtt-will-messages] A
Sparkplug conformant MQTT Server MUST support all aspects of Will Messages including use of the
'retain flag' and QoS 1*#
* [tck-testable tck-id-conformance-mqtt-retained]#[yellow-background]*[tck-id-conformance-mqtt-retained] A
Sparkplug conformant MQTT Server MUST support all aspects of the 'retain flag'*#

[[conformance_sparkplug_aware_mqtt_server]]
==== Sparkplug Aware MQTT Server

A 'Sparkplug Aware' MQTT Server includes all of the aspects of a Sparkplug Compliant MQTT Server.
In addition, it also must have the ability to store NBIRTH and DBIRTH messages of Sparkplug Edge
Nodes that pass through it. Any stored NBIRTH or DBIRTH message must always be the most recent
NBIRTH or DBIRTH that was published to the MQTT Server. In addition, it must make the stored NBIRTH
and DBIRTH messages available to MQTT clients via a retained MQTT message on the appropriate
$sparkplug topic. Note this does not mean that NBIRTH or DBIRTH messages must be published with the
MQTT retain flag set to true. NBIRTH and DBIRTH messages must be published with the MQTT retain flag
set to false. The difference with a 'Sparkplug Aware MQTT Server' is that it will treat NBIRTH and
DBIRTH messages as though their retain flag is set to true even though it is not when published by
a Sparkplug Edge Node.

It is important to note these stored messages are the original NBIRTH and DBIRTH messages published
by each Edge Node. As a result, the metric values can not be expected to be the current values. In a
typical Sparkplug environment the Edge Node likely would have published NDATA and/or DDATA messages
after the NBIRTH and DBIRTH messages denoting metric values that had changed at the Edge Node and
its associated Sparkplug Devices. Consumers of the stored NBIRTH and DBIRTH messages should take
this into consideration when using the information in the stored NBIRTH and DBIRTH payloads.
