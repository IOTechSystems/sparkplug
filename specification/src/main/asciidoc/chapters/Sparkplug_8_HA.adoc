[[high_availability]]
== High Availability

Sparkplug based infrastructures are often used in mission-critical environments. Planning for high
availability is a key requirement for many Sparkplug users. This section discusses non-normative
approaches to achieving high availability.

[[high_availability_for_mqtt_servers]]
=== High Availability for MQTT Servers

A core component of MQTT based infrastructures is the MQTT Server. It is the central data broker and
together with the Primary Host Application a potential single point of failure. All components are
connected to the MQTT Server all the time and a failure of the MQTT Server will cause unavailability
of the whole infrastructure.

There are two options for MQTT Server High Availability in Sparkplug:

. MQTT Server HA Clustering
. Multiple isolated MQTT Servers

Both approaches have been deployed successfully in mission critical environments and depending on
the MQTT Server software used, not all options might be available.

[[high_availability_ha_clusters]]
==== MQTT Server HA Clustering (non-normative)

A single MQTT Server is a single point of failure in a Sparkplug infrastructure, which means a
failure of the Server will cause a downtime for all other components.

MQTT Servers that support clustering allow to install multiple MQTT Servers and connect them to a
cluster. This means all relevant MQTT data is synchronized between these servers. If one or multiple
MQTT Server fail, all data is still present at the other MQTT Servers.

The main advantage of MQTT Server clusters is operations simplicity. Sparkplug components don't need
to distribute state themselves between MQTT Servers (which is required for
<<high_availability_multiple_mqtt_server_topology,Multiple MQTT Server Topologies>>). From the
perspective of an MQTT Edge Node, MQTT enabled Device, or Sparkplug Host Application, any of the
MQTT Servers can be used and devices are not required to be connected to the same MQTT Server. A
MQTT cluster provides the illusion to MQTT clients that there is only one MQTT server while
providing High Availability.

There are two options available for deploying HA MQTT Server clusters:

. High Availability Cluster without Load Balancer
. High Availability Cluster with Load Balancer


[[high_availability_cluster]]
==== High Availability Cluster

In traditional clustered MQTT Server settings, each MQTT Server is reachable by all MQTT Edge Nodes,
Sparkplug Host Applications, and MQTT enabled Devices. Each component can connect directly to any
MQTT Server. A message sent to any MQTT Server will be distributed to all available MQTT Servers in
the cluster (which will distribute the message to all subscribing Sparkplug components).

.Figure 12 – High Availability MQTT Server Cluster

If any MQTT Server would fail, the MQTT connection for components connected to the broker will break
and the component can connect to any other MQTT Server to resume operations.


[[high_availability_cluster_with_load_balancer]]
==== High Availability Cluster with Load Balancer

For dynamic environments where the IP addresses of the MQTT Servers might not be available
beforehand (like in cloud native deployment environments such as Kubernetes) or for cases where it's
not desired that all IP addresses (or DNS lookup names) are configured on the Sparkplug components,
a load balancer might be used.

.Figure 13 – High Availability MQTT Server Cluster with Load Balancer
plantuml::{assetsdir}assets/plantuml/HA-mqtt-server-cluster-with-load-balancer.puml[format=svg, alt="High Availability MQTT Server Cluster with Load Balancer"]

A load balancer acts as the single point of contact for Sparkplug components, so only a single IP
address or DNS name needs to be configured on the components. The load balancer will proxy the MQTT
connections of the components and route to one available MQTT Server. In case of a MQTT Server
failure, the component only needs to reconnect to the load balancer again.

The use of a specific load balancer depends on the MQTT Server used. Usually most load balancers
work with most Sparkplug compatible MQTT Servers on the market.


[[high_availability_multiple_mqtt_server_topology]]
=== Multiple Isolated MQTT Servers (non-normative)

A second approach to high availability is the use of several isolated MQTT Servers. This approach
works with all Sparkplug certified MQTT Servers and does not need cluster technology but requires
Primary Host Applications that support multiple isolated MQTT brokers. The Primary Host Application
is responsible for managing state across the several MQTT brokers.

When multiple MQTT Servers are available there is the possibility of “stranding” and Edge Node if
the Primary command/control of the Primary Host Application loses network connectivity to one of the
MQTT Servers. In this instance the Edge Node would stay properly connected to the MQTT Server
publishing information not knowing that Primary Host Application was not able to receive the
messages. When using multiple MQTT Servers, the Primary Host Application instance must be
configured to publish a STATE Birth Certificate and all Edge Nodes need to subscribe to this STATE
message.

The Primary Host Application will need to specify whether it is a “Primary” command/control
instance or not. If it is a primary instance then every time it establishes a new MQTT Session with
an MQTT Server, the STATE Birth Certificate defined in section above is the first message that is
published after a successful MQTT Session is established.

Edge Nodes in an infrastructure that provides multiple MQTT Servers can establish a session to any
one of the MQTT Servers. Upon establishing a session, the Edge Node should issue a subscription to
the STATE message published by Primary Host Application. Since the STATE message is published with
the RETAIN message flag set, MQTT will guarantee that the last STATE message is always available.
The Edge Node should examine the JOSN payload of this message to ensure that it is a value of
“online=true”. If the value is “online=false”, this indicates the Primary Application has lost its
MQTT Session to this particular MQTT Server. This should cause the Edge Node to terminate its
session with this MQTT Server and move to the next available MQTT Server that is available. This use
of the STATE message in this manner ensures that any loss of connectivity to an MQTT Server to the
Primary Host Application does not result in Edge Nodes being “stranded” on an MQTT server because of
network issues. The following message flow diagram outlines how the STATE message is used when three
(3) MQTT Servers are available in the infrastructure:

.Figure 14 – Primary Application STATE flow diagram

[arabic]
. When an Edge Node is configured with multiple available MQTT Servers in the infrastructure it
should issue a subscription to the Primary Host Application STATE message. The Edge Nodes are free
to establish an MQTT Session to any of the available servers over any available network at any time
and examine the current STATE online value. If the STATE message payload contains ‘online=false’ and
the bdSeq number value in the paylaod matches the bdSeq number in the prior Host Application BIRTH
message then the Edge Node should disconnect and walk to the next available server.
. Upon startup, the configured Primary Application, the MQTT Session will be configured to register
the Primary Host Application DEATH Certificate that indicates STATE is ‘online=false’ with the
message RETAIN flag set to true. Then the Primary Host Application BIRTH Certificate will be
published with a STATE payload of ‘online=true’.
. As the Edge Node walks its available MQTT Server table, it will establish an MQTT Session with a
server that has a STATE message with a JSON payload that contains ‘online=true’. The Edge Node can
stay connected to this server if its MQTT Session stays intact and it does not receive the Primary
Host Application DEATH Certificate.
. Having a subscription registered to the MQTT Server on the STATE topic will result in any change
to the current the Primary Host Application STATE being received immediately. In this case, a
network disruption causes the Primary Host Application MQTT Session to server #2 to be terminated.
This will cause the MQTT Server, on behalf of the now terminated the Primary Host Application MQTT
Client to publish the DEATH certificate to anyone that is currently subscribed to it. Upon receipt
of the Primary Host Application DEATH Certificate this Edge Node will move to the next MQTT Server
in its table.
. The Edge Node moved to the next available MQTT Server and since the current STATE on this server
is ‘online=true’, it can stay connected.
. In the meantime, the network disruption between Primary Host Application and MQTT Server #2 has
been corrected. The Primary Host Application has a new MQTT Session established to server #2 with an
update Birth Certificate with 'online=true’. Now MQTT Server #2 is ready to accept new Edge Node
session requests.
