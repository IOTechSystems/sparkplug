[[security]]
== Security

This chapter is provided for guidance only and is non-normative.

[[security_tls]]
=== TLS
The MQTT specification does not specify any TCP/IP security scheme as it was envisaged that TCP/IP
security would (and did) change over time. Although this document will not specify any TCP/IP
specific security requirements it will provide guidelines on how to secure a Sparkplug
infrastructure.

[[security_authentication]]
=== Authentication
There are several levels of security and access control configured within an MQTT infrastructure.
From a pure MQTT client perspective, the client does need to provide a unique Client ID, and an
optional username and password.

[[security_authorization]]
=== Authorization
Although access control is not mandated in the MQTT specification for use in MQTT Server
implementations, Access Control List (ACL) functionality is available for many MQTT Server
implementations. The ACL of an MQTT Server implementation is used to specify which MQTT topics any
MQTT Client can subscribe and/or publish on. Examples are provided on how to setup and manage
MQTT Client credentials and some considerations on setting up proper ACL’s on the MQTT Servers.

=== Implementation Notes

[[security_implementation_notes_mqtt]]
==== Underlying MQTT Security
All aspects specified in the MQTT Specification's
link:++http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718111++[Security Section] 
[MQTTV3.1.1-5] should be considered when implementing a Sparkplug solution. If using MQTT v5, please
refer to link:++https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901261++[this 
section] [MQTTV5-5] instead.

[[security_implementation_notes_encryption]]
==== Encrypted Sockets
When using public networks and data is sensitive, the underlying socket connections being used by
Sparkplug components should be encrypted. This can be done using
link:++https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246++[TLS] or potential future mechanisms for
securing and encrypting the underlying TCP/IP connection.

[[security_implementation_notes_acls]]
==== Access Control Lists
ACLs can be defined for Sparkplug clients to restrict each Edge Node to a specific set of topics it
can publish and subscribe on. Many MQTT Servers offer the ability to configure ACLs based on client
connection credentials. When supported by the MQTT Server, ACLs offer some security in preventing
compromised credentials from being able to be used to spoof Edge Nodes, write to other Edge Node
outputs, or see all messages flowing through the MQTT Server. Consider the Edge Node with a single
attached Device with the following Sparkplug IDs.
```
Group ID = G1
Edge Node ID = E1
Device ID = D1
```

Based on this, the following could be reasonable MQTT ACLs to be provisioned in the MQTT Server for
the MQTT client associated with this Edge Node:
```
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NBIRTH/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NDATA/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NDEATH/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DBIRTH/E1/D1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DDATA/E1/D1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DDEATH/E1/D1
Subscribe: spBv1.0/STATE/my_primary_host
Subscribe: spBv1.0/G1/NCMD/E1
Subscribe: spBv1.0/G1/DCMD/E1/D1
```

However, there may be other considerations when creating ACLs for clients. It may be the case that
an Edge Node has many dynamic associated devices. In this case, it may make sense to wildcard the
device level topic token. For example, it could look like this:
```
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NBIRTH/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NDATA/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NDEATH/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DBIRTH/E1/+
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DDATA/E1/+
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DDEATH/E1/+
Subscribe: spBv1.0/STATE/my_primary_host
Subscribe: spBv1.0/G1/NCMD/E1
Subscribe: spBv1.0/G1/DCMD/E1/+
```

Also, it may be the case that DCMD messages should not be 'writable'. In this case, maybe DCMD
subscriptions should not be allowed at all. In this case, the ACLs could look like this:
```
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NBIRTH/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NDATA/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/NDEATH/E1
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DBIRTH/E1/+
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DDATA/E1/+
Publish: spBv1.0/G1/DDEATH/E1/+
Subscribe: spBv1.0/STATE/my_primary_host
Subscribe: spBv1.0/G1/NCMD/E1
```

By using ACLs in this way, the access each Edge Node has is restricted to only topics that it should
be able to publish and subscribe on. If the client credentials for some Edge Node were to be
compromised, the potential harm that could be done by a malicious client would be limited in scope.
For example, a client would not be able to appear to be as some other client. Subscribing on # would
not be allowed so the full scope of a Sparkplug topic namespace could not be realized by the
malicious client with the compromised credentials.
