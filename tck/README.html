<h1>Eclipse™ Sparkplug™ TCK</h1>

<p>This is the Eclipse Sparkplug Test Compatibility Kit (TCK).
For Sparkplug certification requests, this TCK should be downloaded in binary form
from <a href="https://download.eclipse.org">Eclipse downloads</a>.
This README is meant to be read as part of that package.
</p>

<h2>Listing Requests for Compatible Products</h2>

<p>Sparkplug is a self-certification ecosystem. If you wish to have your product featured 
in the official list of compatible products, a listing request is required and must be approved
by the Eclipse Sparkplug Specification Project Team.
</p>

<p>There are additional requirements that MUST be met by any organization wishing to use the
“Sparkplug Compatible” logo or [Sparkplug website](https://sparkplug.eclipse.org/) for promotion. 
Any request for listing from an organization not meeting the requirements will be held until such
time as the requirements are met. See the
<a href="https://sparkplug.eclipse.org/compatibility/get-listed/documents/sparkplug-trademark-guidelines.pdf">Sparkplug Trademark Guidelines</a> 
for more information.
</p>

<p>An approved listing request is a statement from the Specification Project that you
have met the intended TCK requirements and is just one of the requirements for logo usage. 
</p>

<p>More information on the process and requirements are available <a href="https://sparkplug.eclipse.org/compatibility/get-listed/">here</a>.
